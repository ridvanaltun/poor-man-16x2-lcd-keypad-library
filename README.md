# What Is It?

It is a patch for chinese clone of [Adaruit's 16x2 RGB Keypad Module](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1110)

Adaruit's library works fine but chinese module hardware have some diffrences. For an example the ada's library can't open backlight because chinese module doesn't have a rgb backlight.
